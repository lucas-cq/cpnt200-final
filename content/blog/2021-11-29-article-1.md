Vue was created in 2014 by a Google employee that wanted an easier way to write code with a lighter framework.

So he made his own. Vue did not immediately blow up, quite the opposite actually. It was a slow start that took a couple years for people to notice. They really started to notice when Taylor Otwell made a tweet endorsing Vue because it was very easy to pick up.

It took Evan You a while to hop on Vue full time, but when he realized it was blowing up he decided to leave Google to start working on Vue with all his energy. Evan built a team with the idea of it being a non corporate setting. This philosophy ensured that everyone felt like they were writing a passion project. Not just an app produced by committee.

Vue is now getting updates regularly thanks to a team with over 60 members. Evan's dream didnt burn up like a lot of framworks now a days. Vue was a much needed framework, that didn't put you down for not being a pro in code. The fact that I could pick it up so easily in a matter of weeks showed its versatility. 

Evan is still working away at Vue to this day. And he will go down in Nerd history as a very important part of code culture.
